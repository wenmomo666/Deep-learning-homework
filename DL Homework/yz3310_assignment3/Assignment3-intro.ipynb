    "### Task 1: XOR net (40%)\n",

    "In this task, we will implement a very simple application of RNN. Char-RNN is a multi-layer Recurrent Neural Network (RNN, LSTM, and GRU) for training/sampling from character-level language models. In this task, you will learn how to build rnn network and some tricks to help better train it.\n",
